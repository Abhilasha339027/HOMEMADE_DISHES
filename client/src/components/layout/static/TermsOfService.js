                YummyMaker.com is always interested in resolving disputes
                amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns be resolved
                quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer
                support at info@YummyMaker.com. If such efforts prove
                unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first
                send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of
                Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to YummyMaker.com should be sent
                to (address given by email only to info@yummymaker.com) (“Notice
                Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of
                the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief
                sought. If YummyMaker.com and you do not resolve the claim
                within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received,
                you or YummyMaker.com may commence an arbitration proceeding.
                During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made
                by YummyMaker.com or you shall not be disclosed to the
                arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if
                any, to which you or YummyMaker.com is entitled.

                Arbitration Procedures
              </Typography>
              <Typography paragraph variant="body2">
                Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in
                accordance with the Ameri Arbitration Association's (“AAA”)
                rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration
                Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
                Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit
                its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules
                and fees for consumer disputes be found at the AAA's consumer
                arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If
                there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and
                any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of
                this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator
                determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
                Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
                arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of
                these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the
                arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues
                relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
                Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are
                usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
                judicial proceedings, the arbitrator award the same damages and
                relief on an individual basis that a court award to an
                individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.
                Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
                overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

                Unless YummyMaker.com and you agree otherwise, any arbitration
                hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for
                both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel
                and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to
                agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If
                your claim is for $10,000 or less, YummyMaker.com agrees that
                you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely
                on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
                telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by
                the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a
                hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the
                manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
                shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
                the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                based.
